# Build you a list

This is an exercise to better understand collection data structures,
particularly lists.

## Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone to your local machine
3. Run `bundle install` to set up dependencies

## Exercise

Run the test suite with `rspec spec/list_spec.rb`. There is a skeleton `List`
class under `lib/list.rb`. Make the necessary change to that file to get the
test suite to pass. Once you do you'll have implemented your own rudimentary
linked list!

**Don't use any of the collection data structures from Ruby. That means no
`Array`, `Hash`, `Set`, etc. The goal here is to make your own from scratch.**

Feel free to use all the fancy Ruby tricks you want. You can add more methods to
`List`, introduce other supporting objects, or even go wild with
metaprogramming. The goal here is to explore what you can do with just raw Ruby
at your disposal.
